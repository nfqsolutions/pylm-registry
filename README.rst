Pylm-registry
=============

Pylm registry is a centralized service for configuration of PALM
clusters.

Pylm
----

Pylm is the Python implementation of PALM, a framework to build
clusters of high performance components. It is presented in two
different levels of abstraction. In the high level API you will find
servers and clients that are functional *out of the box*. Use the high
level API if you are interested in simple communication patterns like
client-server, master-slave or a streaming pipeline. In the low level
API there are a variety of small components that, once combined,
they can be used to implement almost any kind of
component. It's what the high level API uses under the hood. Choose
the low level API if you are interested in creating your custom
component and your custom communication pattern.

Pylm-registry is released under a dual licensing scheme. The source is
released as-is under the the AGPL version 3 license, a copy of the
license is included with the source. If this license does not suit
you, you can purchase a commercial license from `NFQ Solutions

This project has been funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and
Competitivity under the grant IDI-20150936, cofinanced from FEDER
funds.
